# CODESOFT Internship Overview

Welcome to my CODESOFT internship journey! Throughout this internship, I had the privilege of working on three diverse and engaging projects that spanned the realms of data analysis and machine learning. Let's dive into the details of each project:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
In this project, I utilized the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project provided a fantastic opportunity to work with readily available data, including information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data analysis, preprocessing, and classification algorithms

### Repository Structure
```
/titanic-survival-prediction
Tested.csv(data Sets)

## 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project involved building a model to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. Employing regression techniques, the goal was to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates ratings given by users or critics. This project allowed me to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms

### Repository Structure
```

```

## 3. Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project focused on training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset, consisting of species like setosa, versicolor, and virginica, served as a foundation for this introductory classification task.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data preprocessing and classification algorithms

### Repository Structure
```
/iris-flower-classification
