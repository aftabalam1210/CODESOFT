# CODESOFT Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository documenting my internship experience with CODESOFT! During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects: Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction with Python, and Iris Flower Classification. Each project offered unique challenges and allowed me to apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms

## 2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project aims to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. This project involves analyzing historical movie data, performing data preprocessing, and utilizing regression techniques to accurately estimate movie ratings given by users or critics.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms

```

## 3. Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on training a machine learning model to accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, and is widely used for introductory classification tasks.

### Technologies and Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn
- Data preprocessing and classification algorithms

### Repository Structure
```
