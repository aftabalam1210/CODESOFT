CODESOFT Internship Projects
Welcome to the repository documenting my internship at CODESOFT, where I had the exciting opportunity to work on three diverse and impactful projects. Below, you'll find details about each project, including its objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic is a classic beginner project that involves building a predictive model using the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.

Project Highlights
Utilized machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger survived or not.
Explored data analysis, preprocessing, and classification modeling techniques.
Gained insights into feature importance and factors influencing survival.
2. Movie Rating Prediction with Python
Overview
The Movie Rating Prediction project aimed to develop a model predicting the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. This involved using regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and accurately estimate the ratings given by users or critics.

Project Highlights
Explored data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques.
Investigated factors influencing movie ratings.
Built a model capable of accurately estimating movie ratings.
3. Iris Flower Classification
Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project focused on training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The classification was based on measurements of sepal and petal dimensions provided in the Iris dataset.

Project Highlights
Developed a classification model for introductory tasks using the Iris dataset.
Explored feature importance and classification accuracy.
Successfully classified Iris flowers into their respective species.
